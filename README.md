# A Nest.js Rest API

An example of how I implemented a Rest API backend using Nest.js and Supabase

To run the application on `http:localhost:3001`:
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Architecture
The backend is a well structured, modular monolyth using CLEAN & MVC-like architecture (Module / Controller / Service).

## Database
Data is persisted to a Supabase database. Supabase CLI allow us to generate a schema migration that can be applied either to the local database (Docker), either to the production one.

## Authentication
The API is secured using JWT token which is generated by Supabase Authentication and passed along other requests by the client of the API.

## Tests
Tests have been implemented for:
- Products controller and service

To run tests locally:
```
npm run test
```

## Continuous Integration
CI is implemented using a Github Action, defined at `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

It has 2 jobs:
- Tests
- Apply Database Migration
